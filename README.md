📚 Book Sales Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a book sales dataset, highlighting patterns in publishing trends, pricing, genre distribution, and user engagement.

🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to understand:

Trends in publishing years

Sales performance across genres

Relationship between pricing and units sold

Reader engagement via rating counts

📊 Key Insights
Publishing Trend: Most books were published after 1980, with a significant increase post-2000.

Genre Dominance: Genre fiction dominates the dataset, indicating popularity and market preference.

User Engagement: Books under genre fiction also show the highest rating count median and many high outliers.

Sales vs Price: No strong correlation between sale price and units sold; books priced under $15 tend to sell in clusters (either low or high volume).
